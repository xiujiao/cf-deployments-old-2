  # This is used to autocalculate many domain-based values of your Cloud Foundry.
  # Changing it will have widespread changes throughout the installation. If you change

  # To ensure that CF apps have access to talk to their services, we've added a default
  # Application Security Group called `services`. It needs a list of networks that you
  # wish to allow applications to access.

  # To ensure that CF apps can talk to other CF applications, we've added a default
  # Application Security Group to allow access to the CF public IPs. This property
  # needs a list of all the public IPs your Cloud Foundry domains are in front of
  # Try `dig @8.8.8.8 +short myapp.<domain>` for each of your CF domains to get a full
  # list.

  # This tells various CF components to skip strict

  # The `internal_only_domains` are used to tell HA Proxy what domains to refuse requests for
  # unless the requests originate from addresses in the `trusted_domain_cidrs`. This is
  # useful for hiding private domains that only your apps should be able to see. Consider
  # using this even if the domain is not publicly resolvable, as HTTP Host header spoofing
  # could otherwise be used to access the private apps.
  #internal_only_domains: []

  # The `trusted_domain_cidrs` are used to whitelist traffic destined for domains in the list
  # of `internal_only_domains`. If a request goes to an internal only domain, and isn't
  # from the trusted CIDRs, it is blocked. This should be specified as a space-separated list.

  # This is the domain to be used for the `default-tcp' routing
  # group. It should point to a load balancer that lives in front
  # of the `tcp-router' VMs (or directly to the `tcp-router' VM
  # if load balancers are not used). Any apps pushed to CF using
  # TCP traffic instead of HTTP should use this domain.
